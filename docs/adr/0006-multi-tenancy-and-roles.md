# ADR 0006: Adopt Multi-Tenancy and Role Hierarchy as Foundational

## Status

accepted

## Context

The early product docs assumed Phase 1 was single-tenant, with multi-tenancy
deferred ("`company_settings` singleton per organization (Phase 1 single-tenant;
multi-tenant adds `organization_id`)"). In practice the product must support, from
the foundation:

- agencies and hosting operators running **one install for multiple client
  organizations**, and
- a **role hierarchy** where a platform operator manages organizations and an
  organization administrator manages that organization's users.

Sibling product [NeNe Records](https://github.com/hideyukiMORI/nene-records)
already implements exactly this on NENE2 (per-request organization resolution,
`Role`/`Capability` enums, `CapabilityMiddleware`, `organization_id` on
tenant-scoped tables). Retrofitting tenancy later would touch every table,
repository, and route — far more costly than building tenant-aware from day one.

Alternatives considered:

1. **Single-tenant first, retrofit later** — rejected; a later `organization_id`
   migration across all billing tables plus auth rework is high-risk and
   re-opens compliance-sensitive code (issued documents, numbering).
2. **Separate install per tenant only** — rejected; does not serve agencies and
   duplicates operations; the data model should still be tenant-aware.
3. **Multi-tenant foundation, mirroring NeNe Records** (chosen) — tenant-aware
   schema and middleware from the start; a single install may still run as one
   organization via the `single` resolution mode.

## Decision

NeNe Invoice is **multi-tenant from the foundation**, adopting the NeNe Records
architecture.

### Tenancy

- Every tenant-scoped table carries **`organization_id`** (`company_settings`,
  `clients`, `quotes`, `invoices`, `line_items`, `payments`,
  `document_sequences`, `users`).
- The **organization** (`organizations` table) is the tenant. Each organization
  is an independent **issuer** of qualified invoices, with its own
  `company_settings` (legal name, address, **registration number**, bank info).
- Per-request **organization resolution** runs in middleware before authorization
  (mirroring `OrgResolverMiddleware`). Supported modes: **`single`** (default —
  one organization per install), `path` (`/{org-slug}/…`), `subdomain`, and
  `custom_domain`. The resolved organization id is held in a request-scoped holder
  and **every repository query is org-scoped**.
- Document numbering sequences are **per organization and year** (already in
  `domain-model.md`); tenancy makes the scope explicit.

### Roles and capabilities

A `Role` enum and a `Capability` enum, resolved per route by a capability
resolver and enforced by `CapabilityMiddleware` (mirroring NeNe Records):

| Role | Scope | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`superadmin`** | Cross-tenant (platform operator) | All, **including `manage_organizations`**. `organization_id` may be `NULL`. |
| **`admin`** | Single organization | All **except** `manage_organizations` — manages the org's **users**, **company settings** (issuer profile), and billing. |
| **`member`** | Single organization | Billing operator — create/edit/send quotes & invoices, record payments (`manage_billing`, `view_billing`). **Cannot** manage users or settings. |
| **`viewer`** | Single organization | Read-only (`view_billing`). Optional; Phase 3+. |

Capabilities (billing-specific; the set differs from NeNe Records' content
capabilities): `manage_organizations`, `manage_users`, `manage_company_settings`,
`manage_billing`, `view_billing`.

- **Superadmin manages organizations** (`/admin/organizations` — create, list,
  delete tenants).
- **Admin manages users** within the organization (`/admin/users`).
- Role and capability string values are registered in
  [`../explanation/terminology.md`](../explanation/terminology.md) (binding).

### Compliance interaction

- Each organization's issuer registration number and issued documents are scoped
  to that organization; cross-tenant reads are prohibited. This does not relax any
  rule in [`../explanation/accounting-compliance.md`](../explanation/accounting-compliance.md) —
  immutability, numbering, and retention apply **per organization**.

## Consequences

**Benefits**

- Serves agencies/hosting operators and single SMBs from one codebase; `single`
  mode keeps the simple case simple.
- Avoids a high-risk tenancy retrofit across compliance-sensitive billing tables.
- Consistent with the NeNe ecosystem; patterns and reviews transfer.

**Costs**

- Every repository query must be org-scoped — a standing review item
  (`docs/review/database.md`, `docs/review/middleware-security.md`).
- Auth, org resolution, and RBAC are part of the runtime foundation (Issue #4),
  enlarging it beyond a bare health endpoint.

**Follow-up**

- **PR-B (Issue #4 expanded):** runtime foundation — org resolution + JWT auth +
  RBAC wiring + `GET /health`.
- **PR-C+:** organization CRUD (superadmin) and user CRUD (admin).
