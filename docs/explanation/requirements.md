# Requirements

Functional and compliance requirements for NeNe Invoice. MVP scope maps to **Phase 1–3** unless noted.

See also: [`product-vision.md`](./product-vision.md), [`domain-model.md`](./domain-model.md).

---

## 1. Tenancy and user roles

NeNe Invoice is **multi-tenant from the foundation** — see
[ADR 0006](../adr/0006-multi-tenancy-and-roles.md). The **organization** is the
tenant; every tenant-scoped table carries `organization_id`. A single install may
run as one organization via the default `single` resolution mode; agencies use
`path` / `subdomain` / `custom_domain`.

| Role | Scope | Capabilities | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **superadmin** | Cross-tenant | Everything, incl. `manage_organizations` (create/list/delete tenants). `organization_id` may be `NULL` | 1 |
| **admin** | One organization | Everything except `manage_organizations` — manages the org's **users**, **company settings** (issuer profile), and billing | 1 |
| **member** | One organization | Billing operator: create/edit/send quotes & invoices, record payments (`manage_billing`, `view_billing`). Cannot manage users/settings | 1 |
| **viewer** (optional) | One organization | Read-only documents and reports (`view_billing`) | 3+ |
| **public client** | — | Download invoice PDF via time-limited token URL — no login | 2 |

Authorization: a `Role` enum + `Capability` enum resolved per route and enforced
by capability middleware. Role/capability string values are registered in
[`../development/naming-conventions.md`](../development/naming-conventions.md) and
[`terminology.md`](./terminology.md) (binding). Admin JWT for mutating routes.

---

## 2. Core entities (MVP)

All tenant-scoped entities below carry **`organization_id`** (ADR 0006).

| Entity | Purpose | Key fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **organization** | Tenant | name, slug (unique), plan, is_active, custom_domain (optional), external_id (optional) |
| **user** | Operator account | email (unique), password_hash, role (superadmin/admin/member/viewer), organization_id (NULL for superadmin), status (active/invited) |
| **company_settings** | Issuer (自社) profile — **per organization** | organization_id, legal_name, address, phone, email, **registration_number**, bank_name, bank_branch, account_type, account_number, logo_url (optional) |
| **client** | Buyer (取引先) | name, contact_name, email, billing_address, **registration_number** (optional for B2B qualified invoice) |
| **quote** | Estimate (見積書) | client_id, quote_number, issued_at, valid_until, status, subtotal_cents, tax_cents, total_cents, notes |
| **invoice** | Bill (請求書) | client_id, quote_id (optional), invoice_number, issued_at, due_at, status, subtotal_cents, tax_cents, total_cents, **is_qualified_invoice** |
| **line_item** | Row on quote or invoice | parent_type (quote/invoice), parent_id, description, quantity, unit_price_cents, tax_rate_bps, sort_order |
| **payment** | Payment record | invoice_id, paid_at, amount_cents, method (bank_transfer/cash/other), notes |

All money: **integer cents**. Tax rate: **basis points** (1000 = 10.00%).

---

## 3. Japan qualified invoice (適格請求書) — required fields

> **Binding compliance.** The rules in this section are governed by
> [`accounting-compliance.md`](./accounting-compliance.md) (non-negotiable). A
> finance professional reviewing the system must find zero deviations. Any
> departure requires an ADR with tax-professional sign-off.

When `is_qualified_invoice = true`, the system must enforce and render:

### Issuer (supplier)

- [ ] Legal name (氏名又は名称)
- [ ] Address (住所又は所在地)
- [ ] **Registration number** (登録番号) — format `T` + 13 digits
- [ ] Issue date (請求書の交付年月日)

### Buyer (optional on simplified invoices, required for full B2B)

- [ ] Name (氏名又は名称)
- [ ] Address (住所又は所在地) — when provided

### Transaction details

- [ ] Line items: description (取引内容), tax rate per line or document
- [ ] Taxable amount per rate category (税率ごとの対価の額)
- [ ] Consumption tax per rate category (税率ごとの消費税額)
- [ ] Total billing amount (請求金額)

### Validation rules (API layer)

- Registration number regex: `^T[0-9]{13}$` — **syntax check only**. This
  validates format, not existence; the system does **not** verify the number
  against the National Tax Agency registry or compute a check digit. Passing the
  regex does not mean the number is registered or valid.
- Tax rates allowed: 1000 (10%), 800 (8% reduced) — extensible via ADR
- Invoice cannot be marked qualified if issuer registration_number is empty
- Consumption tax is rounded **once per tax rate per document**, never per line
  item — see [ADR 0004](../adr/0004-tax-rounding-per-rate.md)
- PDF totals must match API-calculated cents (single source: UseCase)

## 4. Document lifecycle

| From | Action | To | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | Create quote | quote `draft` | 1 |
| draft | Send / finalize | quote `sent` | 1 |
| sent | Accept | quote `accepted` | 1 |
| sent | Reject / expire | quote `rejected` / `expired` | 1 |
| accepted | Convert | invoice `draft` | 1 |
| — | Create invoice directly | invoice `draft` | 1 |
| draft | Issue | invoice `issued` | 1 |
| issued | Record full payment | invoice `paid` | 1 |
| issued | Partial payment | invoice `partially_paid` | 2 |
| issued | Past due_at unpaid | invoice `overdue` (computed) | 1 |

Quote numbers and invoice numbers: auto-increment per organization with configurable prefix (e.g. `EST-2026-001`, `INV-2026-001`).

---

## 5. MVP features by phase

### Phase 1 — API only

- [ ] Organization resolution middleware (default `single`; path/subdomain/custom_domain) + `organization_id` scoping on every query (ADR 0006)
- [ ] Admin JWT auth + `Role`/`Capability` RBAC (capability middleware)
- [ ] Organization CRUD — superadmin (`/admin/organizations`)
- [ ] User CRUD — admin within organization (`/admin/users`)
- [ ] Company settings CRUD (per organization)
- [ ] Client CRUD + soft delete
- [ ] Quote CRUD + line items + status transitions
- [ ] Invoice CRUD + convert from quote + line items
- [ ] Payment create + list by invoice
- [ ] Qualified invoice field validation
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.1 + PHPUnit + PHPStan 8

### Phase 2 — Admin UI + PDF

- [ ] React admin SPA (clients, quotes, invoices, payments, settings)
- [ ] Admin UI locale catalogs: **ja (primary) + en (secondary)** — no other locales (ADR 0005)
- [ ] Server-side qualified invoice PDF (Japanese layout)
- [ ] Quote PDF (optional, simpler layout)
- [ ] Email invoice PDF via SMTP
- [ ] Public PDF download token URL
- [ ] Dashboard: unpaid / overdue summary

### Phase 3 — Tier A shared hosting

- [ ] Web installer (MySQL credentials, admin user, company name)
- [ ] Release ZIP build script
- [ ] Operator guide (Japanese)
- [ ] Same-origin admin on shared hosting

### Phase 4 — Ecosystem + extensions

- [ ] NeNe Records product import for line items
- [ ] NeNe Concierge webhook → draft client / quote
- [ ] MCP tool catalog (read + write with auth)
- [ ] CSV export for accounting software
- [ ] Payment gateway link (Stripe, etc.) — optional

## 6. API requirements

- JSON API, OpenAPI 3.1 contract
- RFC 9457 Problem Details for errors
- snake_case JSON properties
- Pagination: `limit`, `offset`, `items` envelope
- Admin routes under `/admin/…`
- `GET /health` unauthenticated

---

## 7. Security requirements

- Admin JWT for mutating routes; `Capability` enforced per route (ADR 0006)
- **Tenant isolation**: every query scoped by resolved `organization_id`; cross-tenant reads/writes prohibited. Only superadmin operates cross-tenant
- PDF download tokens: random, time-limited, scoped to one invoice
- No stack traces in production responses
- Secrets in `.env` only — never committed
- Audit log for invoice issue and payment record (Phase 2+)

---

## 8. Explicit non-goals

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| General ledger / journal entries | Different product category; export to accounting SaaS instead |
| Payroll / 給与 | Out of scope |
| Expense receipts / 経費精算 | Out of scope |
| Inventory / stock | NeNe Shop territory |
| PEPPOL / 電子インボイス network | Phase 4+ research; PDF first |
| Multi-currency | JPY only for Phase 1–3 |
| Multilingual UI beyond ja/en | Domain locked to Japanese rules; UI bound to Japanese + English (ADR 0005) |
| Consumption tax filing (申告) | Operator exports data; no tax return generation |

---

## 9. Acceptance tests (Phase 3 smoke)

1. Install on clean MySQL via web installer.
2. Enter company profile with valid `T` registration number.
3. Create client + quote with 2 line items (10% and 8% tax).
4. Convert to invoice, issue, download qualified invoice PDF.
5. Record payment → invoice status `paid`.
6. List overdue invoices returns empty after payment.
