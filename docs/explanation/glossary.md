Canonical English terms for NeNe Invoice public docs, OpenAPI, and code comments.

| Term | Definition | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **quote** | An estimate (見積書) sent to a client before work is confirmed; may convert to an invoice | "estimate" in code identifiers |
| **invoice** | A billing document (請求書) issued to a client | "bill" |
| **qualified invoice** | Japan invoice system compliant document (適格請求書) with required issuer, tax, and registration fields | mixing Japanese in API field names |
| **issuer** | The operator's company that issues quotes and invoices (自社) | "seller", "supplier" in code |
